continuation from yesterday's session we will do a hardware implementaton of the proteus's design. 
we require
1. arduino uno
2. breadboard
3. led
4. some sort of creepy blue wire connects with pc :P 
5. jumper wire M-2-M

now in the breadboard first we connect the sensor
IR reciever- Blue LEDs are emitter and Black LEDs are reciever. 
blue & black both must be connected in the way of the image.
the blue parts of all are going with the ground. and the black portions are going to A0, A1, A2, A3, A4.
Emitter(BLUE) each is series connected with 100Ohms and reciever (Black) each is series connected with 10K Ohms.

LED 
we have used lovely lovely Red LED. Each of red LED is connected with 400 ohm resistance in series. 
then all of them are connected from pin 9 to 13. 

compile the code and forward it!!
Bingo!! it works. now put your hand on the reciever... and those Leds blink. isn't that awesome??? 

now we write some sorts of code in our arduino. now upload it. you will see in a window the voltages in each of the IR reciever.
