2 motors necessary for 2 wheels. the object necessary to attach the wheel with motor is called SHAFT.
When motor rotates

Motor has 2 legs :P One for power, another for Ground.

Motors can be connected to Arduino. but the problem is, Arduino exhebits a very little amount of Current (50 mA), so it will
not work very good. For this reason, MOTOR DRIVER is necessary. Motor Driver is like a Rickshawala :3

It eats the power and does the work for Arduino to move the wheels.

Motor Driver has total 16 pins. In order to connect to the Driver, there is a different way.

Pin 16 will be the VSS (Connecting to Arduino, 5 Volt).

Pin 8 will be for External power Source (9 Volts generally).

Pin 1 is E1 (Enabler 1), that is the one of the motors that would be Driven. and pin 9 (E2) will be the another motor.

I1 (2), I2 (7) will be given digitalWrite(HIGH) and digitalWrite(LOW) respectively for FORWARD MOVEMENT. for BACKWARD MOVEMENT,
the digitalWrites will be reversed.


          PIN  2  7
NOTHING        0  0
FORWARD        1  0
BACKWARD       0  1
(BREAK)        1  1


Pulse Width Modulation:

Our Enabler Voltage looks like a constant graph. When we give Input 1, it goes with full force, and when it's 0, it remains idle.
the function of PWM is to get a Mid value of inputs by average.

In order to do that, we control the ON time/OFF time in a cycle, so that the average value of Motor input gets lower. 


Duty Cycle: It is a perimeter that denotes how much time the Enabler was ON/OFF
